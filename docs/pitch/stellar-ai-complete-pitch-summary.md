## HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE

### For Initial Investor Outreach (Week 1)

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Introducing Stellar AI – The Operating System for Childhood Learning

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm reaching out because I believe we're at the inflection point for AI in education.

We're facing a global crisis: 617 million children are in school but not learning. 
44% of teachers are burned out. Parents are blind to their child's progress.

Yet the technology now exists to solve this completely.

I'm launching Stellar AI: a full-stack platform combining AI mentors + gamification + 
verified credentials + multi-stakeholder dashboards.

Think: "Netflix personalization + Khan Academy content + LinkedIn Learning credentials 
+ Personal Tutor 1-on-1 guidance = Stellar AI"

I've led AI systems teams at Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, and Omnicom. Now I'm applying 
that expertise to education.

Attached: brief pitch deck and executive briefing.

I'd love 20 minutes next week to walk you through it.

Best,
Lars

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### Don't Say These Things:

❌ "We're disrupting education" (too vague)  
❌ "We're like Duolingo but for everything" (doesn't differentiate)  
❌ "We'll be a $10B company in 5 years" (unrealistic)  
❌ "We don't really have competitors" (naive)  
❌ "Teachers will love this because [insert vague benefits]" (not validated)  
❌ "Our AI is better than ChatGPT" (can't prove it)  
❌ "We're raising to build the product" (should be built already)  
❌ "Our TAM is $1 trillion" (too optimistic)  

### Instead Say:

✅ "We're solving a specific problem: personalized learning at scale"  
✅ "We're different from Duolingo because [specific reasons]"  
✅ "We project $55M ARR by Year 3, which implies [valuation]"  
✅ "Here's how we compare to Khan Academy and why we win"  
✅ "We've validated with 10+ schools who want to pilot this"  
✅ "Our AI is tuned for pedagogy, not just conversation quality"  
✅ "MVP is ready. This capital accelerates go-to-market"  
✅ "Our addressable market is $15B+ in the next 5 years, conservatively"
