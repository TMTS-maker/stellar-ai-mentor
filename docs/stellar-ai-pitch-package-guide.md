## KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

### During Pitch

**1. "This is not a chatbot."**
- Make clear: Stellar AI is a complete platform, not just an AI that answers questions
- Emphasize: Pedagogy, gamification, verification, credentials, multi-stakeholder ecosystem

**2. "Perfect timing convergence."**
- Technology is ready (LLMs proven, reliable, affordable)
- Market is ready (teacher crisis, parent demand, school investment)
- Regulatory is clear (GDPR, COPPA frameworks established)
- Teacher shortage cannot be solved by hiring—must be solved by technology

**3. "Defensible moat."**
- Not trying to out-build Khan Academy or out-chat OpenAI
- Combination of four elements competitors can't easily replicate
- Longitudinal learning graph and multi-stakeholder ecosystem = switching costs

**4. "Founder-market fit."**
- Lars brings rare combination: technical depth + business acumen + educational vision
- 12+ years building AI systems at Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, Omnicom
- Not first-time founder playing with shiny tech—systems architect bringing transformational vision

**5. "Clear path to profitability."**
- Unit economics are exceptional (LTV:CAC of 50–150x)
- Multiple revenue streams (B2C, B2B, B2B2C)
- Clear path to $2M ARR in Year 1, $14M in Year 2

## WHAT NOT TO REVEAL

### Protect Your IP

**DO NOT mention:**
- Specific LLM model performance metrics (unless very favorable)
- Exact recommendation algorithm implementation
- Proprietary pedagogy training data
- Specific school partnerships (until they go public)
- Exact feature roadmap (competitors could accelerate)
- Cost structure (unit economics, margin targets)
- Exact team names/contact info (until ready to hire)

**DO NOT share:**
- Closed source code
- Internal architecture diagrams (keep high-level)
- Financial model details (only summary numbers)
- Student data (even anonymized)
- Internal roadmap (stick to 4-phase public roadmap)

**INSTEAD:**
- Use the language from the pitch deck (tested, vetted)
- Speak in principles, not implementation details
- Focus on outcomes, not technical mechanics
- Emphasize moat without revealing moat details

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### After Sending Pitch Package

**Track:**
- Email open rates

- Investor questions (quality vs. skepticism)

**Adjust if:**
- Low open rates → Refine email subject line
- High bounce-off rate on Slide 3 → Problem statement unclear
- Many Q's on financials → Add more detail to financial slides
- Q's on technology → Add technical appendix (optional)
- Slow decision timelines → Emphasize urgency ("pilot starting Q4")
